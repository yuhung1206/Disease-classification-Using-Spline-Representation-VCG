# Disease-classification-Using-Spline-Representation-VCG  





**Myocardial infarction (MI)**-induced changes in the morphological and temporal wave features are extracted from the derived **VCG** using **spline approximation**.  

After the feature extraction, a classifier based on **multilayer perceptron network (MLP)** is used for MI classification.  

Experiments on **PTB diagnostic database** demonstrate that the proposed system achieved satisfactory performance to differentiating MI patients from healthy subjects and to localizing the infarcted area.

## Execution  

1. **Spline-based feature extraction**  
    Note: all input signals(derived,real) must have been **preprocessed**  
      
    - Main program: `SplineFeatureExtract.m`  
    - Sub programs: `SplineFit_1_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`, `SplineFit_2_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`, `SplineFit_3_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`, `pan_tompkin.m`

      |Code |function|
      |-----|--------|
      |`SplineFit_k_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`|extract feature from k leads & generate label for learning |
      |`pan_tompkin.m`|R-peak detection      |   
      |`plotATM.m`| Load .mat and .info files
        
    -  Get function "plotATM.m" from physionet website  
      :point_right: https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/plotATM.m 
    
    
    - ReconFlag and lead_I_Flag:

    - Output Name & directory for features  
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/VNY5v8I.png)
    - Input filename
    make sure that input filename is correct

    - Choose how many leads to extract:  
      `SplineFit_1_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg` -> 1 lead features(18)  
      `SplineFit_2_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg` -> 2 lead features(35)
      `SplineFit_3_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg` -> 3 lead features(52)
          
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/nUn0MeP.png)
    
        - For `SplineFit_1_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`  
          `singal(1,:)`-->X lead  
          `singal(2,:)`-->Y lead  
          `singal(3,:)`-->Z lead  
          ![](https://i.imgur.com/go6UP8R.png)
        
       - For `SplineFit_2_Lead_Exclude_NoSeg.m`
       The example of X+Y leads is shown below:

 2. **Multi-Layer-Perceptron** `MLP`  
    Note: input are features rather than signals  
    
     - Main program: `Classification_SMOTE.m`
     - Sub programs: `mySMOTE.m`
    
        |Code |function|
        |-----|--------|
        |`Classification_SMOTE.m`|FNN for classification|
        |`mySMOTE.m`|deal with the imbalanced database|  
    
    - Get `mySMOTE.m` from :point_right: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/70315-smote-over-sampling  
       - What is **SMOTE**?  
       - ...coming soon
    
    - make sure InputName is correct:
